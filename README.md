# StokesCode
Simple fenics code corresponding to solving a varying density Stokes problem on a rectangle and on a cube, with density parametrised as input. Analytical solution is computed with errors. Tested with python 3.6.9 version and Fenics version 2019.1.0.
To check Fenics version : in python type : 

import dolfin as df

print (df.__version__)
